#Rails Lite

This is Rails Lite, it is a project meant to show you how what rails does
behind the scenes.

To play around with this project, you can run the following:
  - ruby bin/basic_server.rb
  - ruby bin/controller_server.rb
  - ruby bin/params_server.rb
  - ruby bin/router_server.rb
  - ruby bin/session_server.rb
  - ruby bin/template_server.rb

Have some fun!
